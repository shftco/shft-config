## Installation
Go to the root of the project and run the following command:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shftco/shft-git-config/main/husky/script.sh)
```

That's it! You can now use the [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) hook for your project with using [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).

## Usage
You can configure the ./husky/pre-push file to run any command you want before pushing to the remote repository.
