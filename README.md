# SHFT Git Configuration
Common git configuration for SHFT projects.

## Installation
Go to the root of the project and run the following command:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shftco/shft-git-config/main/script.sh)
```

That's it! You can now use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook for your project with using [git-conventional-commit](https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits).
